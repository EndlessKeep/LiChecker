This module provides a number of basic commonly used RNN cells, such as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and a number of operators that allow adding dropouts, projections, or embeddings for inputs. Constructing multi-layer cells is supported by the class `MultiRNNCell`, or by calling the `rnn` ops several times.
